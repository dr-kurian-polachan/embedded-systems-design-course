# Embedded Systems Course
A Course offered by [Dr. Polachan at IIIT-Bangalore](https://sites.google.com/view/cdwl/professor).

## Course Overview
This course covers topics including:

Introduction and overview of mixed-signal system design, the architecture of mixed-signal SoCs, I/O subsystem (I/O types, drive modes), memory types, microcontroller subsystem,  digital subsystem (counter, PWM), analog subsystem (ADC, PGA), electrical specifications (absolute maximum ratings, device and subsystem specifications), basics of SoC packaging, board design, firmware design (booting sequence, interrupt handling), IC programming, bootloader concepts, embedded communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART), ultra-low power design considerations (low-power modes, watch-dog timers), power management (dc/dc converters, linear regulators), case studies of mixed-signal system designs (e.g., on-body wearable designs).

Introduction to electronics packaging. Types of IC packages and their comparisons. Introduction to PCB and its Components: Traces, pads, vias, layers, etc. PCB materials and their properties. Fabrication process: From design to a physical board. Importance of hierarchy in complex designs. Blocks, sub-circuits, and modules; top-down vs. bottom-up design. Introduction to schematic design. Transition from schematic to layout. Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools overview and hands-on sessions. Component selection: How to choose components from different vendors. Bill of Materials (BOM) management.  Gerber and other manufacturing files: Their importance, generation, and validation. Submitting designs to PCB fabs: Understanding lead times, costs, and design reviews. Introduction to soldering: its importance and types. Materials and equipment used in soldering: solder, flux, soldering iron, etc. Soldering techniques, best practices, and safety precautions. Hands-on soldering assignments with various components. Introduction and design of rigid-flex PCBs, their advantages, and limitations.
