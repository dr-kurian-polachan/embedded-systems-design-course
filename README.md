- Electrical specifications: Absolute maximum ratings, device, and subsystem specifications  
- Firmware design, IC programming, and bootloader concepts  
- Embedded communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)  
- Power management: Ultra-low power design  
- Case studies of mixed-signal system designs (e.g., on-body wearable designs)

### VL 603 - Electronics Systems Packaging  
**Offered**: 2024  

**Course Contents**:  
This course covers a range of topics in electronics systems packaging, including:  
- Introduction to electronics packaging, types of IC packages and their comparisons  
- Introduction to PCB and its components (traces, pads, vias, layers, etc.)  
- PCB materials and their properties, PCB fabrication process 
- Hierarchical PCB designs (blocks, sub-circuits, and modules; top-down vs. bottom-up design)  
- Introduction to schematic design and layout using KiCAD or Altium Designer  
- Component selection (choosing components from different vendors), Bill of Materials (BOM) management
