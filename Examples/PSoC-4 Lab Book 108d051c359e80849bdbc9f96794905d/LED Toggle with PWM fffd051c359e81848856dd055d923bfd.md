# LED Toggle with PWM

We are given three LEDs, each of them toggling at the rate of 1 sec, 1.5 sec, 1.75 sec respectively.

The clock frequency is set at 1 KHz and the respective Period and Compare values of the PWMs are as follows

- PWM_1 : Period = 2000   Compare = 1000
- PWM_2 : Period = 3000   Compare = 1500
- PWM_3 : Period = 3500   Compare = 1750

We have assumed a duty cycle of 50 % and the time with which the LED is ON is calculated using $T_{ON} = \frac{Compare}{Freq_{CK}}$.
